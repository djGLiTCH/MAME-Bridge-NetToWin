This tool is designed to enable "output windows" as an additional add-on tool when you have "output network" set in MAME, as natively you can only choose "windows" or "network" in MAME settings (mame.ini).

To enable simultaneous dual output, configure MAME to output "network" (find the relevant "output" line in "mame.ini" and set this to "output network").

If you are using LEDBlinky, you may need to ensure all ROMs are loaded with the command "-output network" when launching ROMs with MAME, as LEDBlinky can revert the output setting in mame.ini from "network" to "windows" despite making mame.ini read-only.

If "network" output is detected on 127.0.0.1:8000 for MAME, then this tool will interpret all state outputs received by the TCP server and relay them to windows by simulating the native MAME "output windows" method, which is used by tools like LEDBlinky or MameHooker.

NOTE: I would recommend using this tool with Hook Of The Reaper over MameHooker, as that is what I have tested with. Hook Of The Reaper (https://github.com/6Bolt/Hook-Of-The-Reaper) uses "network" output, which is why LEDBlinky can access the "windows" output created by this tool.
